    <h2>A Whole Team Approach</h2>
	<h3>What is it?</h3>
   	<p>Mob programming, also know as mobbing, is a software develpment approch. Basically, a whole team with the needed skills and knowledge work together:</p>   
    	<ul><li>on the same time</li>
        <li>at the same time</li>
        <li>in the same space</li>
        <li>at the same computer</li></ul>
     	<p>"Humans are notoriously bad at multitasking"<br>
         - Jason Kerney (Full Stack Engineer)</p>        
  		<p>Mob Programming provides a solution for a developer to multitask. As people's ability to perform tasks changes on a day-to-day basis, the quality of the code that is written can vary. With Mob Programming the code is written at the highest capability at the time, since there are multiple eyes on the code.</p>
